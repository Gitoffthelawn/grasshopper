Grasshopper is a Firefox extension for tab management.

It has 4 item modes: Tabs, Stars, Closed, and History.

Tabs display all your open tabs, and you can interact with them.

Stars are like bookmarks that you save manually.

Stars can be used to open websites easily.

Closed are recently closed tabs.

History searches and filters browser history.

There's useful buttons like Playing and Clean.

Playing focuses the tab that is emitting sound.

So you can return easily to what you were watching or listening to.

Clean closes all the tabs which are not pins or playing.

So if you have many tabs open, you can hit Clean and keep only the important ones.
